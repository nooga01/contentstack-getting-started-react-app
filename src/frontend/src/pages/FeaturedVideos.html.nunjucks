            <h3>Our role as the NSW Consumer Trustee under the NSW Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap</h3>
            <p>The NSW Government appointed AEMO Services as the independent Consumer Trustee, to protect the long-term financial interests of NSW electricity consumers. This responsibility is at the core of everything we do under the NSW Electricity Roadmap.
            </p>
            <p>AEMO Services is a key partner in the implementation of the Roadmap. We are trusted to plan, partner and progress long-term investment to help transform the energy sector.
            </p>
            <p>In the Infrastructure Investment Objectives (IIO) Report, we identify the timing and scale for renewable energy generation and storage investment. We incentivise these new investments through tenders for LTESAs. Through our rolling schedule of competitive tenders and coordinated investment planning, we act in the long-term financial interests of NSW electricity consumers to support a future network that delivers quality energy, where and when it is needed.
            </p>
            <p>Whilst our most prominent task as Consumer Trustee is to plan for, design and operate the tender process for new infrastructure in generation, firming and long-duration storage, we also play a lesser known, yet important and very specific role â€“ an independent check on REZ network infrastructure project recommendations provided by EnergyCo.
            </p>
